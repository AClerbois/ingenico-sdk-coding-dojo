/*
 * Ingenico Direct
 *
 *  # Introduction  The Ingenico Direct API has been designed as a REST API. It uses the HTTP protocol as its foundation. Each resource is accessible under a clearly named URL and the HTTP response codes are used to relay status. HTTP Verbs like GET and POST are used to interact with the resources. To support accessibility by clients directly, as opposed to your server, our servers support cross-origin resource sharing. We use JSON for all of our payloads, including error messages   All these characteristics mean that you will be able to use standard off the shelf software to interact with Ingenico ePayments. To make the integration even easier, Ingenico ePayments also has SDKs that wrap both the complete Server API as well as the complete Client API.
